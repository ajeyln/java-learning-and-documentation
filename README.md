## <a name="Background"></a>Background

Java is a high-level programming language and it is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. Java has many features such as dynamic coding, multiple security features, platform-independent characteristics, network-centric designing, etc.

This repository contains notes and some exercises related to different java concepts and packages.

This will be constantly updated with relative exercises to get Handson experience

### Basic
In this section , we will understand the basic syntax and semantic rules for the language, along with the various constructs, mathematical operations as well as repetitive programming constructs.

### Object Oriented Programming
Object-oriented programming System(OOPs) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects” that contain data and methods. The primary purpose of object-oriented programming is to increase the flexibility and maintainability of programs. Object oriented programming brings together data and its behaviour(methods) in a single location(object) makes it easier to understand how a program works.

### Advanced

In this repository I have identified some advanced topics for future references <br />
 
This will be constantly updated with relative exercises to get Handson experience <br />
